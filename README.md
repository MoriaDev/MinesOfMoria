# MinesOfMoria
A graphical based Rougelike application for Android (based on Pixel Dungeon)

This application takes the Pixel Dungeon code produced by Watabou.ru and greatly expands the graphics, music, and levels.
Taking from also the Dungeons of Moria by Robert Alan Koeneke and James E. Wilson, also an incredibly difficult and addicting single player dungeon game originally written in VMS Pascal back in 1983.
